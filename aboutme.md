Welcome but nothing's here! 

![heihei](/assets/img/kit_point.jpg)

Hi I'm Zixi Chen and I go by Chelsea! I'm a master's student in Data Science at Harvard, where I'm advised by Dr. Weiwei Pan and Prof. Finale Doshi-Velez. I earned my B.S from University of California, Los Angeles in the spring of 2021, with a double major in Applied Mathematics and Statistics with a Specialization in Computing.
